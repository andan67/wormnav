WormNav User Guide
===================================

WormNav is a ConnectIQ app for a number of Garmin wearables that allows an autonomeous 
navigation along a given course (track/route). The 'worm' refers to the fact that only the course is displayed on the device screen as one dimensional line along with the current position cursor. This type of navigation should be good enough for many scenarios to safely follow a course in an unknown terrain.

The course data is created by an Android companion app and tranmitted via Bluetooth to the Garmin wearable.

WormNav is mainly targeted at those Garmin wearables which do not have a built-in course feature and include
- Forerunner 23x, 245, 6xx, 735xt
- vivoactive series
- Venu series

# Installation and basic set-up

# Important notes and limitations
- Use of the app for navigation is at your own risk
- The number of course points heavily impacts the memory and power consumption as well as the performance (screen refresh rate) of the app
- For the Forerunner 235, the following limits and performance figures have been determined   
  - Maximum number of points: ~300 with or ~450 without elevation data
  - For a 300 points course with elevation data:
    - Course view: refresh time ~370ms with power consumption ~8.5% per hour
    - Profile view: refresh time ~870ms with power consumption ~13% per hour
- For other, especially newer devices the limitations and performance figures might be much higher
- It is highly recommended to use the optimize feature of the companion app for tracks/routes with large number of points. A maximum error of ~10m induced by the optimization process should be good enough for many use cases.
- On Forerunner 235 and likely with other older and low spec Garmin devices, the transmission or storage of courses with large number of points might fail. If an optimization is not possible, the limit can be extended by deleting a loaded course from the app (from Course menu).
- If the course profile view is active, the point on the course that is nearest to the current position is determined by a projection method. This expensive procedure explains the lower refresh rate and higher power consumption compared to the course view. Note that the current position might still be at a large distance from the course, which would make the current elevation and distance data potentially very inaccurate. The actual distance can be assessed from the course view. Also the passed distance can be wrong at start or end at round courses and in general at course segments which are close to each other.
